1. Functionality

This plugin was written to enable an easier use of any Unicode glyph
available. The unicode.vim Plugin uses the data available from the Unicode
Consortium's website (http://www.unicode.org) to let you enter Unicode
characters using a completion function.

By default, the plugin creates a directory unicode below the path autoload
where this plugin is located. Within this directory it will store  the file
UnicodeData.txt from http://www.unicode.org/Public/UNIDATA/UnicodeData.txt
which it will try to download using |netrw| . If this is unsuccessfull, or
you do not have |netrw| enabled, dowload the file manually and save it in the
unicode directory below the autoload directory in which unicode.vim is
located.


						 *:EnableUnicodeCompletion*
By default the plugin is not enabled. To enable it enter: >

    :EnableUnicodeCompletion

When you run this command, unicode.vim checks for the availability of
UnicodeData.txt from the Unicode Consortium, and if it is not available,
it will try to download it. 

This will also set up the completion function |completefunc| to use for your
buffer. You can use |i_CTRL-X_CTRL-U| then to start the completion. 

						 *:DisableUnicodeCompletion*
If you want to disable the plugin, enter >

    :DisableUnicodeCompletion
<
	 						 *:UnicodeName*
Suppose, you want to know, what the Unicode Name for the Character under the
cursor is. You simply enter the ex command: >

    :UnicodeName

The plugin will then output the character, the character's hexadecimal value
and the official Unicode name.

						    *unicode-plugin-usage*
2. Completing Unicode chars

If you have enabled the plugin using |:EnableUnicodeCompletion| then there are
2 possibilities to use the plugin. You can either enter the Unicode Character
name, or enter the Unicode-Codeposition.

For example, you would like to enter Æ, so you enter AE and press |<C-X><C-U>|
while in insert mode. Alternatively you can enter the Unicode-Codepoint: U+C6
and press |<C-X><C-U>| and the popup menu will show you all characters, that
have a codepoint like C6 with leading zeros, eg. U+00C6 and U+0C66

A popup menu will appear, showing you the Unicode-Codeposition value, the
Unicode Character Name and the Unicode Character (and if you have enabled it,
it can also show you the digraph characters needed to create this character in
paranthesis, see |unicode-plugin-config| ). You can scroll down in the menu by
pressing <C-N> and up by pressing <C-P>.

Regardless, of you configured the plugin to display the digraph shortcut in
the menu, a |preview-window| will be opened, if your Vim was compiled with the
quickfix-feature and the preview window displays the hexadecimal Unicode
Codepoint, the name, the digraph characters in parenthesis (if they exist)
followed by the glyph itself.

						    *unicode-plugin-config*
The plugin can be customized to include the 2 digraph characters you have to
type, to get that character. This works only, if there is a digraph defined
for that Unicode char. If you would like this you need to set
g:showDigraphCode, e.g. >

    :let g:showDigraphCode=1

This functionality is by default disabled, cause it seems to cause some delay
and screen-rendering errors in the menu. However, the preview window will
always show the digraph character in parenthesis. 
Enter >

    :let g:showDigraphCode=0

to disable the Digraph feature afterwards.

If you would like to specify a different URL from which to download
UnicodeData.txt, enter the URL as: >

    :let g:unicode_URL='http:....'

To force downloading the file from that new url, enter >

    :call unicode#CheckUniFile(1)

If you'd like Unicode completion to be always enabled, you can set the
variable g:enableUnicodeCompletion to 1 in your |.vimrc| like this: >

     let g:enableUnicodeCompletion = 1
<
Thus, you won't need to use EnableUnicodeCompletion, it will be already
available.

If you only want to complete the Unicode Names instead of the glyphs,
you can either set the global variable >

    let g:unicode_complete_name = 1
<
or you can use the mapping <leader>un which swaps the completion function
between completing the unicode name and completing the unicode glyph.

						     *unicode-plugin-error*
If the plugin gives an error or does not complete anything, first check, that
UnicodeData.txt from the Unicode Consortium has been successfully downloaded.
It should be located below the autoload/unicode.vim script in a directory
called unicode. So if you have installed unicode.vim into
/home/user/.vim, UnicodeData.txt should be located at:
/home/user/.vim/autoload/unicode/UnicodeData.txt and should look like this:

0020;SPACE;Zs;0;WS;;;;;N;;;;;
0021;EXCLAMATION MARK;Po;0;ON;;;;;N;;;;;
0022;QUOTATION MARK;Po;0;ON;;;;;N;;;;;
0023;NUMBER SIGN;Po;0;ET;;;;;N;;;;;
0024;DOLLAR SIGN;Sc;0;ET;;;;;N;;;;;
0025;PERCENT SIGN;Po;0;ET;;;;;N;;;;;
0026;AMPERSAND;Po;0;ON;;;;;N;;;;;
0027;APOSTROPHE;Po;0;ON;;;;;N;APOSTROPHE-QUOTE;;;;
0028;LEFT PARENTHESIS;Ps;0;ON;;;;;Y;OPENING PARENTHESIS;;;;
0029;RIGHT PARENTHESIS;Pe;0;ON;;;;;Y;CLOSING PARENTHESIS;;;;
[...]

If the file looks correct, and the plugin is still not working correctly
contact the maintainer. You'll find his email-adress in the first line of this
document. Please be patient, it might take a while, until I can take care of
your report.

					*i_CTRL-X_CTRL-G* *digraph-completion*
3. Completing digraphs

CTRL-X CTRL-G		Search for the character in front of the cursor and
			try to complete this letter using a digraph. If there
			is no letter in front of the cursor, a list with all
			available digraphs is shown in a popup menu.
			(Think of Glyph)
       CTRL-N           Use next match. This match replaces the previous
			match.
       CTRL-P           Use previous match. This match replaces the previous
			one.

4. unicode History			              *unicode-plugin-history*

			  the function
    0.9: Jul 20, 2011:  - |:UnicodeName| checks for existence of
			  UnicodeData.txt

			- Code cleanup
			- Make use of the preview window, when completing
			  Digraph or Unicode Glyphs
			- By default, the Digraph Glyphs will now be enabled
			  using |i_Ctrl-X_CTRL-G| instead of using
			  Ctrl-X_Ctrl-C which wouldn't work in a terminal
			- |:UnicodeName| now displays the hexadecimal Unicode
			  Codepoint instead of the decimal one (as this seems
			  to be the official way to display unicode
			  codepoints).
    0.7: Sep 23, 2010:  - |:UnicodeName|
                        - specify g:enableUnicodeCompletion to have unicode

			  wget)
			- small documentation update (Inlude a snippet of
			  UnicodeData.txt and get rid of Index.txt data)
