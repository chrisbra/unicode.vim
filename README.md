#Unicode plugin
==============
> A Vim plugin for handling unicode and digraphs characters

This plugin aims to make the handling of unicode and digraphs chars in Vim easier. It serves 3 purposes:

    1. Complete Characters
    2. Identify Characters
    3. Ease the use of Digraphs

###Complete Characters
    Once you have enabled completing of Unicode Characters (`:EnableUnicodeCompletion`) a custom completion function is available to complete characters using their Unicode name or Codepoint. If a digraph exists for that character, it will be displayed in paranthesis. Press `Ctrl-X Ctrl-U` to trigger this completion from insert mode.
    Also a new custom completion for digraph chars is available. Press `Ctrl-X Ctrl-G` to trigger this completion. It will display all digraphs, that are reachable from the previous typed letter.

###Identify Characters
    The `:UnicodeName` command can be used to identify the character under the cursor. This works similar to the builtin `ga` command (in fact, the help also states a possibility to map this command to the `ga` builtin command), but it also displays the digraph character (if it exists) and the HTML entity.
    The `:SearchUnicode` command can be used to search in the unicode character table to search for a certain unicode character with a given name or value.

###Ease the use of Digraphs
    Use the `:Digraphs` command to search for an digraph with the given name (e.g. `:Digraphs copy` will display all digraphs that will create a character name which contains copy in its name). You can also search for the decimal value.
    This plugin also maps the key `<F4>` that will allow to transform 2 given normal chars into their digraph char.
